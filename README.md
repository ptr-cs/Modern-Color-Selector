# Modern-Color-Selector
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extensible and compact color selector implemented in C# with WPF. Features highly-customizable default ControlTemplate and interactive 3D color models. Works as both standalone (with test application) and as an imported Control. Protoyped with Adobe XD and tested with NUnit unit testing framework.

- Supports RGB, HSL, and HSV color modes, with hexadecimal RGBA string support
- Error-checking for input fields with validation feedback
- Minimal code footprint (two main files - ColorSelector.cs and Themes/Generic.xaml, with organized supporting files)

# Setup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The repository consists of three Visual Studio projects - the ColorSelector project, a companion standalone application project, and an NUnit unit testing project. Opening the ColorSelector/ColorSelector.sln file in Visual Studio should allow all projects to be built and run. To use the ColorSelector as a Control in another WPF application, add the ColorSelector project to the parent solution in Visual Studio, then add a project reference to the ColorSelector project for any projects that will use the ColorSelector.

# In-Progress
- Menu settings for number of presets and custom colors
- Configuration settings support
